## Description

This module introduces the Unix shell language and covers file and directory navigation and manipulation. Participants gain proficiency in various commands, script creation, and writing basic functions using pipes, filters, and loops. 

Participants will acquire problem-solving skills through live coding sessions. Additionally, they will explore the concept of reproducibility and its integration into their work.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, participants will be able to:
* Comfortably access and navigate the terminal
* Create, modify and delete directories and files


## Activities
This module has two types of activities.
1. Assignments are mandatory, and form part of your evaluation.
1. Homework is not assessed, but are provided to you for extra practice. We encourage you to check each other's homework solutions during Work Periods or ask a Learning Support!

### Assignments
Participants should review the [Assignment Submission Guide](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md) for instructions on how to complete assignments in this module.

Assignments are typically due on the Sunday following the module's live learning session.

## Delivery of the Learning Module

This module will include live learning sessions and optional, asynchronous work periods. During live learning sessions, the Technical Facilitator will introduce and explain key concepts and demonstrate core skills. Learning is facilitated during this time. Before and after each live learning session, the instructional team will be available for questions related to the core concepts of the module. Optional work periods are to be used to seek help from peers, the Learning Support team, and to work through the homework and assignments in the learning module, with access to live help. Content is not facilitated, but rather this time should be driven by participants. We encourage participants to come to these work periods with questions and problems to work through. 
 
Participants are encouraged to engage actively during the learning module. They key to developing the core skills in each learning module is through practice. The more participants engage in coding along with the instructional team, and applying the skills in each module, the more likely it is that these skills will solidify. 

## Schedule

||Jan 7|Jan 9|Jan 10|Jan 14|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Week 1|Live Learning Session 1 ([Shell](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/shell))|Live Learning Session 2 (Git & Github)|Work Period|Live Learning Session 3 (Git & Github)|
 
## Requirements

* Participants are not expected to have any coding experience; the learning content has been designed for beginners.
* Participants are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance their learning experience.
* Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect participants to have completed the steps in the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/).
* We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.

### How to Get Help
#### 1. Gather information about your problem
- Copy and paste your error message
- Copy and paste the code that caused the error, and the last few commands leading up to the error
- Write down what you are trying to accomplish with your code. Include both the specific action, and the bigger picture and context
- (optional) Take a screenshot of your entire workspace

#### 2. Try searching the web for your error message
- Sometimes, the error has common solutions that can be easy to find!
   - This will be faster than waiting for an answer
- If none of the solutions apply, consider asking a Generative AI tool
   - Paste your code, the error message, and a description of your overall goals

#### 3. Try asking in your cohort's Slack help channel
- Since we're all working through the same material, there's a good chance one of your peers has encountered the same error, or has already solved it
- Try searching in the DSI Certificates Slack help channel for whether a similar query has been posted
- If the question has not yet been answered, post your question!
   - Describe your the overall goals, the context, and the specific details of what you were trying to accomplish
   - Make sure to **copy and paste** your code, your error message
   - Copying and pasting helps:
      1. your peers and teaching team quickly try out your code
      1. others to find your question in the future
