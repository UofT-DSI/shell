## Description
This section of the module will start by introducing the fundamental language of Unix shell, covering topics such as file and directory navigation and manipulation. Following this, students will gain proficiency in various commands, script creation, and the development of basic functions utilizing pipes, filters, and loops. 

Throughout this section of the module, participants will acquire problem-solving skills through live coding sessions. Additionally, they will explore the concept of reproducibility and its integration into their work.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, learners will:
* Develop the ability to comfortably access and navigate the terminal
* Develop the skills to create, modify and delete directories and files

## Assignments
**The Secret Password Assignment:** You are stuck in a virtual room and can only leave if you figure out the password! Fortunately, somebody left behind 5 clues for you to find the secret password, but the messages are somewhat unclear. It is your job to discover what the secret password is!

## Contacts
**Questions can be submitted to the _#questions_ channel on Slack or as an email**

* Technical Facilitator: 
  * name and pronouns: `<Name>`, `<Pronouns>` 
  * email: `<first_name.last_name@mail.ca>`
* Learning Support Staff: 
  * name and pronouns: `<Name>`, `<Pronouns>` 
  * email: `<first_name.last_name@mail.ca>`
 
## Delivery of Module
The module will run synchronously twice a week on Zoom. The first two days are used as "lectures" and will last a maximum of 3 hours. During this time, the technical facilitator will introduce the concepts for the week. The last two days are used for as optional, asynchronous work periods. The work periods will also last for up to 3 hours. During these two days, a technical facilitator or learning support will be present on Zoom to assist learners reach the intended learning outcomes.

### How the Technical Facilitator will deliver
The technical facilitator will introduce concepts through collaborative demonstrations and the use of slides.
 
### Expectations
Learners are encouraged to be active participants in coding and to ask questions throughout the module.

## Schedule
The schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.

||Day 1|Day 2|Day 3|Day 4|Day 5|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Week 1|Lecture 1 (Shell)|Lecture 2 (Shell)|Lecture 3 ([Git & Github](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/git))|Work Period 1|Work Period 2|
 
## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this module more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Module communications:** Communications take place over email or on Slack. If communicating over email, please include "DSI-Shell" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Shell: bash question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which **is not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be two assignments which **are** graded.
 
## Requirements
* Learners are not expected to have any coding experience; we have designed the learning content for beginners.
* Learners are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Learners must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect learners to have completed the instructions mentioned in the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/).
* Using a camera is optional but highly encouraged. We understand not everyone may have the space at home to keep the camera on.
