# **Unix Shell Homework**
```console
$ echo "Data Sciences Institute"
$ echo "by: Rachael Lam"
```

##### **Expectations**
The goal of this homework is to give students an opportunity to practice what was learned during each class. This will help students remember the content and prepare for the next class.

Because each class builds upon the last, it's important to review the content and become comfortable with it, as time is too limited for a full in-class review.

---
##### **Due Dates**
Homework will be released after each class and is due on the day of the next class. For example, after class on Monday, the homework prompt will be released and then homework is expected to be handed in at any time on Thursday.
