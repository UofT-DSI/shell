# Shell / Git Assignment
You work in the data team at a consulting firm, and one of your team's products is helping companies optimize and manage their cloud hosting expenditures.

Your team has an existing bash script that initializes an analysis directory for each new client.

You've been asked to update this script to also automate the initial organization of data files provided by clients.

## Instructions

### Setup
1. **Forking the Repository**: If you have not already done so, fork this Shell learning module repository following these [instructions](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md#setting-up). 
   - Forking creates a copy of the main repository in your GitHub account. This allows you to work on your version without affecting the original repository.
2. **Create a Branch for Your Work**: To keep your changes organized, create a new branch named `assignment`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b assignment
   ```

### Part 1: Update the Data Ingest Script
1. **Modify the Script**: Using the template in ``02_activities/assignments/assignment.sh``, fill in the correct commands as described by the comments.
    - It may help to paste your commands into the Terminal as you write your script (or vice versa) to test as you go
2. **Test Your Script Locally**: Execute your script to ensure it works as expected. You may need to make additional tweaks and re-run it until you are satisfied with the results.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: As you complete parts of your script and confirmed that it is working correctly, commit your changes to ensure your progress is saved.
    ```bash
    git commit assignment.sh -m "describe your changes here"
    ```

### Part 2: Merge in Updates from Your Coworkers
Your coworkers have made some other changes to the script. You'll need to incorporate their updates and resolve any conflicts.
1. **Merge the Updates**: Use the following command to pull in changes from the coworker's branch:
   ```bash
   git pull https://github.com/UofT-DSI/shell coworker-changes --no-rebase
   ```
2. **Resolve Merge Conflicts**: If there are any conflicts, use ```git status``` to see which files are affected, resolve the conflicts manually, and then mark them as resolved.
3. **Commit the Merge**: Once all conflicts are resolved, commit the merge.

---

### Part 3: Test Your Script
1. **Re-test Your Script**: Make sure that your script still works after merging the updates.
2. **Optional Clean Test Setup**: If you'd like to test your script in a clean environment, follow these steps:
   ```bash
   mkdir assignment_test_clean    # make an empty directory
   ```
   ```bash
   cp assignment.sh assignment_test_clean    # copy your script into the empty directory
   ```
   ```bash
   cd assignment_test_clean    # change your working directory to the new clean directory
   ```
3. **Run Your Script**:
   ```bash
   bash assignment.sh
   ```
4. **Verify the Output**:
   - Check if the expected directories are created.
   - Verify that files are moved or copied as expected.
   - Ensure that files that should be deleted are no longer present.

### Submit Your Changes for Review
1. **Commit Your Final Changes**: Ensure all changes are committed in your `assignment` branch. You can verify this with:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. **Enable GitHub Actions**: Click on the **Actions** tab in your repository and enable workflows if prompted.
