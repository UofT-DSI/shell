      Create a directory structure for a project with the following hierarchy:
      ```
      project/

      │   ├── main.py
      │   └── utils.py
      ├── data/

      You are trying to run a script but encounter an error. The script is supposed to print the current date and time.
      However, it fails with the following error:
      ```
      bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory
      ```
      What is the likely cause of this error?
    questiontype: multiplechoice
    options:
      - The script does not exist in the current directory.
      - The script does not have execute permissions.
      - The script is not in your PATH.
      - There is a syntax error in the script.
    solution: The script does not exist in the current directory.

      Suppose this is the contents of a directory on your computer:
      ```bash
      user@computer:~$ ls ~
          myfile.txt    mydata.csv    myscript.sh   myfolders/
      ```

      When you type the following commands, you get an error:
      ```bash
      user@computer:~$ mv mydata.csv myfolder/
          mv: cannot move 'mydata.csv' to 'myfolder/': No such file or directory
      user@computer:~$ mv myfile.txt myfolder/
          mv: cannot move 'myfile.txt' to 'myfolder/': No such file or directory
      user@computer:~$ mv myscript.sh myfolder/
          mv: cannot move 'myscript.sh' to 'myfolder/': No such file or directory
      ```
      
      How can you fix this error?
    questiontype: freeform

      mv mydata.csv myfolder/
      mv myfile.txt myfolder/
      mv myscript.sh myfolder/
    solution: |
      The error indicates that the directory `myfolder/` does not exist.
      Ordinarily, we could create the directory using the `mkdir` command, but in this case, it looks like the directory is already created as `myfolders/`.
      To fix the error, we can either create the directory `myfolder/` or move the files to `myfolders/` instead.

      ```bash
      user@computer:~$ mv mydata.csv myfolders/
      user@computer:~$ mv myfile.txt myfolders/
      user@computer:~$ mv myscript.sh myfolders/
      ```

  - title: "Organizing files"
    description: |
      Suppose this is the contents of a folder on your computer:
      ```bash
      user@computer:~$ ls /data/MYPROJECT/scripts
          analyze_data.py     dataset1.db        dataset2.db      outputimg.png       
          outputimg2.png
      ```

      You've just opened a new terminal and want to organize the files by moving datasets and outputs in separate folders.
      Select and order the following commands to accomplish this task.
    questiontype: parsons
    options:
      - "`cd /data/MYPROJECT`"
      - "`mkdir datasets`"
      - "`mkdir outputs`"
      - "`mv dataset* datasets/`"
      - "`mv scripts/dataset* datasets/`"
      - "`mv output* outputs/`"
      - "`mv scripts/output* outputs/`"
      - "`cd data`"
      - "`cd outputs`"
      - "`echo scripts/output*`"
      - "`movefile dataset* datasets/`"
      - "`movefile output* outputs/`"
      - "`cd`"
      - "`ls`"
    solution: |
      ```bash
      user@computer:~$ cd /data/MYPROJECT
      user@computer:/data/MYPROJECT$ mkdir datasets
      user@computer:/data/MYPROJECT$ mkdir outputs
      user@computer:/data/MYPROJECT$ mv scripts/dataset* datasets/
      user@computer:/data/MYPROJECT$ mv scripts/output* outputs/
      ```
